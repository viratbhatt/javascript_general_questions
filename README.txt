Rules - do not use inbuilt methods
      Problem 1 - Given an array of numbers, change each element to its cube
        Example: [1,2,3] -> [1,8,27]
      Problem 2 - Find the largest and second largest element in an array
        Example: [4,7,1,4,9] -> 9,7
      Problem 3 - Given a number n, print reverse of n
        Example: 1234 -> 4321
      Problem 4 - Given a string s, print if it's a pallindrome or not
        Example: "ababa" is a pallindrome
      Problem 5 - Give two strings, check if they are anagrams
        Example: "may", "amy" -> Yes, they are anagrams
      Problem 6 - Find the factorial of a given number
        Example: 5 = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
      Problem 7 - Sort a given array of numbers
        Example: [4,3,1,9] -> [1,3,4,9] Hint: Use Recursion
      Problem 8 - Find most occurring character in a string
        Example: "aabbcdefa" -> a
      Problem 9 - Remove duplicates from an array
        Example: [1,2,1,2,3] -> [1,2,3] , ["a","a","b","cb"] -> ["a", "b", "cb"]
      Problem 10 - Reverse a sentence
        Example: "quick brown fox" -> "fox brown quick"
      Problem 11 - Check if the given string has a number
        Example: "abc1_ef" -> Yes, the string has a number
      Problem 12 - Given two sorted arrays of numbers, join them, the resulting array should be sorted
        Example: [1,4,9] & [2,3,12] -> [1,2,3,4,9,12]
